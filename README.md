# Reader Mode

This is a lightweight plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that ensures every filled note opens in reader mode by default. It’s perfect for those who prefer to primarily read their notes – just like browsing Wikipedia – while still having the flexibility to quickly switch into editing mode when needed.

Reader Mode is ideal for notes with footnotes, embeds, images, or code snippets, offering a more comfortable reading experience. It also resolves the issue where links become unclickable in edit mode if the cursor happens to be inside them when the note is opened.

Empty notes will be opened in edit mode.
